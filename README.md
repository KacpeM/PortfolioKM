# PortfolioKM

Hello, I'm Kacper and I want to become a full automation tester. I have always liked solving tasks and problems. 
I am precise and meticulous in what I do, if I don't know something, I will always find out because nothing is impossible.

I am currently developing my skills in SQL, Java and Git. 
I already have the basics of using IntelliJ, REST API and Maven. I am interested in the possibility of development and gaining knowledge.

In my portfolio, I add various types of tests that I do while learning.
Currently, I already have UI tests prepared, which I will constantly add and develop. 
I'm also going to add a REST API over time.
